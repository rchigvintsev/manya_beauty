# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      Welcome to my site! My name is Marina Chigvintseva. Since I can remember
      (about five years), I have always sewn. First I invented the attires for
      dolls, then for myself. I have never considered sewing as a profession,
      but rather as a given (every woman can sew, so what :)), as a pleasant
      pastime, a hobby. Therefore I have a chemistry degree and I was honestly
      taking chemistry for a few years, but I never left my passion. Eventually
      I realized that sewing gives me more fun and takes more thinking than
      the profession. I sewed more and more, faster and faster and the more I
      sewed, the more ideas I had, the more I wanted to bring them to life.
      Finally I came to the conclusion that I must have two lives to wear all
      things that I wanted and most importantly I could to sew and I lose sleep
      and appetite because of unrealized ideas. So I began to sew for my
      friends, acquaintances, then for friends of my friends, for acquaintances
      of my friends, for acquaintances of my acquaintances, etc. And now the
      hobby turned into a profession thanks to my beloved husband, who supported
      me at the moment of responsible choice and instilled confidence in me, and
      my customers, who trust me and give me the opportunity to create for them
      at my pleasure. I am sincerely interested in every my customer, I try not
      just to sew a thing, but to create a harmonious image, that adorns a woman
      and gives her a comfort and a confidence. For that I strive to improve
      myself all the time, learn and grow professionally and develop creatively.
      My special passion are dresses and coats. I adore to sew it, especially
      long dresses and nonstandard coats. So if your soul craves an originality
      and is not afraid of experiments you are welcome.
